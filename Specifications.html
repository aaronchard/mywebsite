    <h3> We'll choose the best candidates for the role, which may include you. We will provide you with training to help you work harder and more efficiently. We would provide you with the opportunity to demonstrate your abilities while working with us by allowing you to collaborate with top companies such as Amazon. You must have at least 5 GCSEs at grade 4 or above, as well as an A-Level or BTEC equivalent. It would be extremely beneficial if you had prior job experience or basic training, but it is not necessary.
